Can K-12 schools sign the Climate Leadership Commitments?

No, these Commitments are designed for institutions of higher education. 
However, there are other networks addressing K-12 schools. 
For example, the Green Schools Alliance has launched a similar initiative. USGBC supports the Center for Green Schools.

Endowments are made up of thousands of different investment accounts,
many of which can be restricted. That means the donor specified what the money could be used for. 
Sometimes it's scholarships. Sometimes it's the library, or maybe it's the football team.

Here's an example: A donor gives money to an endowment to fund scholarships for 100 low-income students.
The fund's manager is obligated to invest that money in a way that it can fund 100 scholarships this year, 
and each year going forward.

If the donor wanted it to be a one-time gift to build a new student union building, 
they would do just that -- make a one-time gift rather than donating to the endowment. 

--Harvard' endowment is the universitiy's largest financial asset 
and is made of more that 13k funds.

"Each of Harvard’s twelve Schools “owns” its share of the endowment. 
Roughly 80 percent of the funds that make up the endowment are dedicated by the donor to 
a specific School. School revenue profiles vary widely, and each draws a different 
proportion of its budget from its endowment.

Contributions may be given in support of a specific School, 
program, or activity, and can only be used for those purposes."

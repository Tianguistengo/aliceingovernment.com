- Forums for students to talk and learn about sustainability

- University of British Columbia "The university has a website dedicated to sustainability,
where students can find out more about what the university is doing to be more sustainable, 
upcoming events, tips on how to be more environmentally friendly
-----------> and student groups on climate action. 

-"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s sustainability programme, 
the Three Zeros Environment Initiative, was established in 2016. The initiative aims to reduce
the campus environmental footprint in three ways: 
net zero water,
zero waste to landfills
and net zero greenhouse gases.
---------> The university marks its progress across these goals on the programme’s website.

-University at Buffalo "Some of these measures include introducing a car-sharing programme for staff and students
and encouraging students to use other modes of transport,
to offer students environmentally-themed courses
and incorporate sustainability into all courses across the curriculum.

-University of Waterloo

The Interdisciplinary 
Centre for Climate Change at the University of Waterloo has developed a number of initiatives 
that involve students in the climate change conversation. 

The Climate Students Group brings
together students across study levels and disciplines
to discuss and act on climate change. 




-Times Higher Education methodology for ranking universities in terms of climate action:


1. Research on climate action (27%)

    Proportion of papers in the top 10 per cent of journals as defined by Citescore (10%)
    Field-weighted citation index of papers produced by the university (10%)
    Number of publications (7%) 

This focuses on research that is relevant to climate action. 
The field-weighted citation index is a subject-normalised score of the citation performance of publications.

The data are provided by Elsevier’s Scopus dataset, based on a query of keywords associated with SDG 13 (climate action). It includes all indexed publications between 2013 and 2017. The data are normalised across its range using z-scoring. 


2. Low-carbon energy use (26.9%)

This measures the amount of renewable and low-carbon energy used by the institution. 
It refers to the gigajoule (GJ) of electrical energy provided by renewable or nuclear energy.

This data and evidence were provided directly by universities. 
The data are normalised across its range using z-scoring. 


3. Environmental education measures (46.1%)

    Providing local education around the impact of climate change (9.75%)
    Generating a university climate action plan (9.75%)
    Working with local or national government to address climate change planning (9.75%)
    Informing and supporting government on issues associated with climate change (8.45%)
    Collaborating with NGOs around climate change (8.4%) 

This data and evidence were provided directly by universities. 
The evidence was evaluated and scored by Times Higher Education and is not normalised.
